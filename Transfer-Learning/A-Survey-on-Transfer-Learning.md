# 논문 구성
we first give a general overview and define some notations

We, briefly survey the history of transfer learning, give a unified definition of
transfer learning and categorize transfer learning into three
different settings (given in Table 2 and Fig. 2). 

For each setting, we review different approaches, given in Table 3 in detail. 

After that, in Section 6, we review some current
research on the topic of “negative transfer,” which happens
when knowledge transfer has a negative impact on target
learning. In Section 7, we introduce some successful
applications of transfer learning and list some published
data sets and software toolkits for transfer learning research.
Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of future
works in Section 8.
