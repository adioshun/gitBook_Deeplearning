we  propose  two  novel constrains in the design of deep structure to guarantee the performance gain when going deep(깊은 네트워크를 구성하여도 성능을 보장하는 2가지 제약에 대하여 제안한다.)

1. Firstly, for each convolutional layer, its capacity of learning more complex patterns should be guaranteed

2. Secondly, the receptive field of the topmost layer should be no larger than the image region
